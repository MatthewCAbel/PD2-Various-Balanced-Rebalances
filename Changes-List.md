# Weapons

Pump Shotguns: Pickups have been massively buffed to get them on par with the M1014 and Predator.

Why?: Pump shotguns have always been very hard to use as their pickups are incredibly lackluster and their DPS isn't good enough to justify this. The M10 and Pred have always pretty much been straight upgrades. This change is to get the shotguns more in line with each other to enable more variety.

Assault Rifles: Lion's Roar's damage has been reduced to 67, pickup and and max ammo have been reduced slightly. ROF has been reduced to 800.

Why?: The Lion's Roar was very overtuned by Overkill when they buffed it, this change is to get it more in line with other weapons in the class, rather than being objectively better. It can still hit 2 shot heavy with a compensator so we believe this gives it a nice niche

Pistols: High damage pistols have been massively reworked, the pistols have had their ROFs, ammo counts and mag size reduced, but have been given a one shot heavy breakpoint. Their pickups have been changed to compensate for this. Revolvers have been changed into a spammier option with worse stats, but they still reach the heavy one shot.

Why: This change was done to give pistols more practical use as sidearms while still being useable in dedicated pistol builds, They can now be used as heavy one tapping side arms. Their ROFs have been reduced so that they can't be spammed as hard, and their mag size and ammo counts have been massively reduced. Their pickups are also fairly implemented so you still need to aim well to maintain ammo.

Snipers: 168 firerate has been buffed to 180. Lebensauger has been changed to be a middle ground between Contractor and Grom.
Why?: This is to compensate for the graze changes in this mod. It keeps DPS higher without making them too strong. Lebensauger has been set to be in the middle of the grom and contractor instead of being an updgrade to either of them.

# Skills

Graze: Damage on ace skill has been reduced to 75%

Why?: Graze is an incredibly strong skill as it can wipe out entire rows of cops with a single click. This skill is to reduce the power it has by making it so you need to effectively prioritize targets or shoot multiple times to kill groups. It will also still provide stagger when hitting so it can still be used effectively with this change. 

Ammo Specialist tree: Extra Lead is now tier 2, Fully Loaded is now tier 3 and Bulletstorm is now tier 4.

Why?: Bulletstorm is far too powerful for a tier 2 skill, it gives you minutes of infinite ammo for practically nothing. We believe it fits much better as the tier 4 of the tree. Extra Lead has been placed at tier 2 as we believe it is arguably the least powerful skill in the tree and that it works well as the tier 2. Fully Loaded works incredibly well as the tier 3 skill. It gives you a nice boost to pick up and it helps with a lot of loadouts such as DMRs.
