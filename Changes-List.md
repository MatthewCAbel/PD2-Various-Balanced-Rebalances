# Weapons

Mid to High Damage Shotguns: Pickups have been massively buffed to get them on par with the M1014 and Predator.

Why?: Pump shotguns have always been very hard to use as their pickups are incredibly lackluster and their DPS isn't good enough to justify this. The M10 and Pred have always pretty much been straight upgrades. This change is to get the shotguns more in line with each other to enable more variety.

All of the shotgun nerfs since 2021 have been reverted (minus the dragon's breath nerf).

Why?: Shotguns were never overpowered and these changes just made them less fun to use. These have all been reverted to make shotguns fun to use again.

IZHMA: Taktika Rail Cover has had the damage bonus removed and has been given a +8 stability bonus instead.

Why?: The IZHMA being a one shotting machine makes it stupidly overpowered, especially with the DRF changes. It basically never runs out of ammo and slays everything. We also plan to change the VD-12 in the future for the same reason. 

Assault Rifles: Lion's Roar's damage has been reduced to 67, pickup and and max ammo have been reduced slightly. ROF has been reduced to 800.

Why?: The Lion's Roar was very overtuned by Overkill when they buffed it, this change is to get it more in line with other weapons in the class, rather than being objectively better. It can still hit 2 shot heavy with a compensator so we believe this gives it a nice niche

Pistols: High damage pistols have been massively reworked to give them a more interesting role, the pistols have had their ROFs, ammo counts and mag size reduced, but have been given a one shot heavy breakpoint. Their pickups have been changed to compensate for this. Revolvers have been changed into a spammier option with worse stats, but they still reach the heavy one shot. This was done to create new build dynamics and give people more options for what they use as a sidearm.

Why: This change was done to give pistols more practical use as sidearms while still being useable in dedicated pistol builds, They can now be used as heavy one tapping side arms. Their ROFs have been reduced so that they can't be spammed as hard, and their mag size and ammo counts have been massively reduced. Their pickups are also fairly implemented so you still need to aim well to maintain ammo.

Snipers: Lebensauger has been given 12 in the mag and 48 max ammo. Ammo pickup has been reverted to pre-buff stat.

Why?: We tried to make the Lebensauger a nice middle ground between the Contractor and Grom in terms of ammo rather than basically being a grom.

DRF has been completely removed.

Why?: The changes overkill made with it added were completely unnecessary and all it does is make stuff like shotguns and SMGs more annoying to use, while buffing guns that don't need it such as snipers. We may go back to it in the future to see if we can do something interesting with it. As of now, we have decided to completely remove it.

# Skills

Confident and Stockholm Syndrome have switched spots.

Why?: Two converts are incredibly strong for a tier 2 skill and stockholm syndrome isn't so good in comparison. This changes them around to make two converts harder to obtain to make up for the huge amount of targetting they soak up.

Ammo Specialist tree: Extra Lead is now tier 2, Fully Loaded is now tier 3 and Bulletstorm is now tier 4.

Why?: Bulletstorm is far too powerful for a tier 2 skill, it gives you minutes of infinite ammo for practically nothing. We believe it fits much better as the tier 4 of the tree. Extra Lead has been placed at tier 2 as we believe it is arguably the least powerful skill in the tree and that it works well as the tier 2. Fully Loaded works incredibly well as the tier 3 skill. It gives you a nice boost to pick up and it helps with a lot of loadouts such as DMRs.

Graze has been changed to the skill Mind Blown (created by Hoppip: https://modworkshop.net/mod/22193 https://github.com/segabl/pd2-mind-blown) This mod changes graze to a chaining effect, affecting enemies up to 5 times when aced.

Why?: Vanilla Graze is incredibly opressive and can hold down entire maps with ease. Previous attempts at changing graze involved changing how much damage the skill does, but I though this really made snipers unfun to use as their killing power was greatly reduced. I believe this change will keep the skill relevant while still maintaining the fun of snipers as it keeps them in check while still allowing them to excel if you can aim well.

# Enemies 

Tasers and shields have had their damages reverted to before 240.3.

Why?: This nerf mostly just served to buff LBV and make tasers and shields less threatening for no good reason. We decided to undo this to make tasers and shields more dangerous.
